            <h2>A classic take on an American favorite!</h2>
                <p>This is the dish that everyone expects to see on the table during the holidays! I know it's certainly one of my favorites. </p>
                <p>This Green Bean Casserole recipe comes from the Campbell's website - tender green beans tossed in cream of mushroom sauce with crispy fried onions sprinkled on top! It pairs wonderfully with a roast turkey or chicken (which is featured in the next recipe!). The secret to making this the perfect side dish is to use fresh string beans and add more fried onions on top! </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 can (10 1/2 ounces) Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup or 98% Fat Free Cream of Mushroom Soup or Condensed Unsalted Cream of Mushroom Soup</li>

                </ul>
