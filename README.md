# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipe website that was originally assigned to me by the Odin Project (TOP).

The goal of this build is to demonstrate and showcase the skills that I have learned in HTML thus far in my self-study from TOP. 

Website features will include the following: 
- A main index page, which will have links to a few recipes
- Appropriate headers for recipe titles
- Images, including alternate text descriptions
- Lists, representing ingredients and recipe steps
- Links to other pages
